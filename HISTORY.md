# Version History

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, the major version reflects the highest step of [the challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) that has been completed in sequence. 

For example, upon completion of step 3 (CSS) and all previous steps, the major version should be 3. 

You may optionally increase minor and patch versions as you progress through a particular step.
